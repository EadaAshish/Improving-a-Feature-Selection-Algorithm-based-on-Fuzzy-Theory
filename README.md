# Improving-a-Feature-Selection-Algorithm-based-on-Fuzzy-Theory

This study details an investigation into 24 software defect datasets gathered by various authors using various methodologies. The main goal was to apply the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevancy â€“ Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (mRMR-HFS) approach and improve the present algorithm's performance. Many Feature Selection approaches were also employed to compare the amount of improvement with the newly proposed upgrade of the mRMR-HFS algorithm. The minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevancy (mRMR) method is at the heart of mRMR-HFS, which improves the mRMR by calculating Information Energies to quantify relevance and redundancy using Hesitant Fuzzy Sets. The model was trained using the KNN classifier, and the performance was calculated using the AUC score. The mean ranking of algorithms and statistical information were derived using AUC scores. ARP (Aging Related Bug Prediction), JIRA, and PROMISE databases are part of a collection of 24 datasets. The algorithm and classifier's performance is measured separately for each dataset group and across all datasets. The suggested upgrade on mRMR-HFS fared the best out of all the other algorithms based on these classifiers and algorithms.
